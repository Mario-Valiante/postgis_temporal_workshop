The goal of this workshop is to walk through several examples of how to use 3rd and 4th dimension data with PostgreSQL and PostGIS with a particular emphasis on using M values with points and linestrings.

<notes>
PostgreSQL has very extensive support for temporal data using the Timestamp, TimestampTZ, Date, Time, TimeTZ, and Interval data types. PostgreSQL is very forgiving as to how data can be input as plain text.

It should be noted that in almost all cases it is better to use the Time Zone aware TimestampTZ and TimeTZ data types as the non timezone aware Timestamp and Time can be lossy and ambiguous in most circumstances. 

Further, while PostgreSQL is incredibly tolerant of text data input formats, ISO8601 should be the preferred method for communicating with dates and times. Day/month/year and month/day/year can be particularly problematic as they are each preferred in different parts of the world.

### Exercise: Convert different text formats into timestamps

```sql
SELECT '2017-01-01 00:00-6'::timestamptz;

SELECT '2017-01-01'::timestamptz;

SELECT '4/5/2017'::timestamptz;
```
---

---
<notes>
Day/month/year and month/day/year can be particularly problematic as they are each preferred in different parts of the world.
</notes>

### Exercise: Use session settings to control Timestamp in/out

```sql
SET datestyle to dmy;
SELECT '4/5/2017'::timestamptz;

SET datestyle TO DEFAULT;
SELECT '4/5/2017'::timestamptz;
```
---
<notes>
By using the TimestampTZ data type it becomes easy to view the data in whatever locality is necessary at the moment.
</notes>

### Exercise: Use session settings to control Timezone in/out

```sql
SELECT now();

SET TIME ZONE 'Europe/Rome';
SELECT now();

SET TIME ZONE 'UTC';
SELECT now();

SET TIME ZONE 'PST8PDT';
SELECT now();

SET TIME ZONE DEFAULT;
SHOW TIME ZONE;
SELECT now();

SELECT timezone('UTC', now());

SELECT now() AT TIME ZONE 'America/Chicago';
```

---

<notes>
PostgreSQL also has an interval type that can maintain periods of time
</notes>

```sql
SELECT '1 day'::interval;
SELECT '2016-01-01'::timestamptz + '3 months'::interval;
```
---
<notes>
When no proper Time Data Types are available, one convenient way of dealing with time is to use Unix Epoch time. This is the number of seconds since the start of the Unix Epoch (1979-01-01). We will see later that using Unix Epoch can be very handy when we start to look at PostGIS Linear Referencing.
</notes>

## Exercise: Convert between Time Data Types and Epoch Seconds
```sql
SELECT to_timestamp(0);

SELECT timezone('UTC',to_timestamp(0));

SELECT extract(epoch from '2017-01-01'::timestamptz);

SELECT extract(epoch from '1 hour'::interval);
```
---
<notes>
For convenience sake if you are doing this conversion frequently, PostgreSQL makes creating your own functions very easy. Let's create custom functions for converting Intervals and TimestampTZ into Epochs.
</notes>

## Exercise: Create custom functions for converting to Unix Epoch
```sql

CREATE FUNCTION to_epoch(IN timestamptz, OUT float8) AS $$
    SELECT extract(epoch from $1);
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

CREATE FUNCTION to_epoch(IN interval, OUT float8) AS $$
    SELECT extract(epoch from $1);
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT to_epoch('2017-01-01'::timestamptz);
SELECT to_epoch('1 hour'::interval);
```
---
<notes>
It can be very convenient to also be able to "round" time.
</notes>

## Exercise: Truncate timestamps.
```sql
SELECT date_trunc('month', now());
SELECT date_trunc('month', now()) + '1 month'::interval;
```

```sql

SELECT st_dumppoints(geom) FROM superior100 limit 10;
SELECT (st_dumppoints(geom)).* FROM superior100 limit 10;
```
---

```sql

WITH t AS (SELECT st_dumppoints(geom) as dump FROM superior100)
SELECT 
    (dump).path[1],
    st_asewkt((dump).geom), 
    st_x((dump).geom), 
    st_y((dump).geom)
FROM t 
LIMIT 10;
```
---
```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS superior100_points;
CREATE TABLE superior100_points AS

SELECT 
    (dump).path[1],
    (dump).geom, 
    st_x((dump).geom) as x, 
    st_y((dump).geom) as y
FROM t;
```
---
```sql

```
---
```sql

WITH t AS (SELECT path, x, y, z, round((z-lag(z) OVER (ORDER BY PATH))::numeric,1) elchange FROM superior100_points)
UPDATE superior100_points p SET elchange=t.elchange FROM t WHERE p.path=t.path;

SELECT x, y, z, elchange FROM superior100_points limit 10;
```
---
```sql

SELECT 
    3.28 * sum(elchange) FILTER (WHERE elchange>0) as gain, 
    3.28 * sum(elchange) FILTER (WHERE elchange<0) as descent
